		<p>Story&rsquo;s talks pages can highlight upcoming appearances, promoting your talks
before you present. This is a dummy page illustrating this capability.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to add <code>buildFuture: true</code> to your site&rsquo;s <code>config.yaml</code> to enable
this setting.  Talks pages that are in the future won&rsquo;t appear on the homepage
or in your RSS feeds; they&rsquo;ll only appear in the <code>/talks/</code> list page of your
site.</p>
<p>This page also illustrates that you can use PDF slides. Story uses PDF.js to embed a slide viewer.
So you don&rsquo;t have to build slides in RemarkJS, you can host them yourself, like Slideshare (but better).</p>
