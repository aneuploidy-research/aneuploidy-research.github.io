This is a dummy page illustrating this capability.\nYou’ll have to add buildFuture: true to your site’s config.yaml to enable this setting. Talks pages that are in the future won’t appear on the homepage or in your RSS feeds; they’ll only appear in the /talks/ list page of your site.\nThis page also illustrates that you can use PDF slides. Story uses PDF.js to embed a slide viewer. So you don’t have to build slides in RemarkJS, you can host them yourself, like Slideshare (but better).\n","keywords":null,"title":"A Future Talk","uri":"https://aneuploidy-research.github.io/talks/a-future-talk/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Peter Benn is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences at the University of Connecticut, USA.
